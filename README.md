By default, the app is pointed to a [Sync Gateway](https://github.com/couchbase/sync_gateway) instance hosted by Couchbase on a demo server.  

If you want to user your own Sync Gateway instance, you can change the URL in the `SYNC_URL` variable to point to your instance.  You'll want to use the following [Sync Gateway Config](https://github.com/couchbaselabs/ToDoLite-iOS/blob/master/sync-gateway-config.json)
